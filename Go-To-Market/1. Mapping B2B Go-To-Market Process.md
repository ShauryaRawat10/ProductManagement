#### How to build your go-to-market strategy
- Companies face challenges daily - competition, changing markets, finding and keeping new customers, as a result you might think they have marketing problem, sales problem or Customer success problem. What you have is go-to-market problem. It requires marketing, sales, and customer success to all be on same page and to know the answer to the question - What should we do next?
- Accelerating the revenue and scaling the business
- Some of the Companies are super successful, not beacuse they have an excellent product or strong brand. But, because they took time to build strong GTM teams. 


#### Navigating GTM as a process

- 5 million new businesses launch annually in US, and most of them never hit million dollar in revenue. Starting a business is easy but scaling a business is hard. It becomes increasingly difficult to cut through the noise and talk to audience directly. GTM is all about standing out and making your customer notice you.
- If you have trouble connecting with your customer, what you are facing is Go-To market problem.
- Solving it need to Create an iterative process to bring clarity, alignment and togetherness to your team.

###### Stages of a business
- Problem market fit: Have leads, but can't convert them to customers
  - Marketing and sales are not aligned, they are still learning. Each team is doing its own thing
- Product market fit: Customer acquisition is repeatable, but few renewals
- Platform market fit: Can retain customers, but struggling to increase wallet share

###### Clarity and Alignment
- Start with creating a target customer list
- Marketing, sales and customer success team must know "What stage of business", "what they are targeting" and "why they are targeting"

Eg: If you are selling marketing software to fortune 500 companies in the financial services industry. Create a target list in 3 easy steps:
1. View list of fortune 500 companies
2. Filter them with finnacial services companies
3. Share the list with teams

#### Who do you think owns GTM
- CEO of the company owns Go-To-Market
- CEO needs following 5 metrics:
  - Annual recurring revenue: How fast you are acquiring your new customers
  - Annual contract value: How much money customer is willing to pay annually
  - Gross retention rate: How many customer are renewing annually
  - Net revenue retention: how more products /services, customer is willing to pay for
  - Category Growth: How fast your company is growing compared to its competitors

#### GTM Questions: CEO would start asking these questions
- Where do we need to invest?
- How do we budget?
- When do we need to hire?

We treat GTM like a product and we track bugs and make improvements

## Defining your niche in B2B GTM
- "Small is the new big" When you start a business you may need to focus on specific area
  - TAM - Total Addressable market (100%)
  - TRM - Total Relevant market (0% - 10%)
- Focus on TRM instead of TAM
- When you narrow your focus and identify total relevant market, your niche is directly linked to stage of business you are in - as we talked about - Problem, product and platform market fit
  - Problem market fit: Find out if the problem you are fixing resonates with the market
    - Once you have 100 customers atleast, you would know which features your customers love the most, from those 100, you might see 20 customers that see most benefit from product and are ready to pay
  - Product market fit: Identify segment
  - Platform market fit: Once you have 1000 customer, more than one segment will start emerging.
