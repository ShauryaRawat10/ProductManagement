 Product Analytics: The act of capturing and analyzing how users interact with digital products by calculating product usage
                    Product usage can be measured by 3 ways:
                    1. Trends : Graph engagement with certain features or pages and compare it against other parts of the product over time
                    2. Funnels : Track the levels of drop-off at each step accross specific subset of features and pages in the product
                    3. Paths : View all the product journeys users take either leading up to or following a specific interaction, plus a measure 
                               of how common or uncommon the next step being taken is

                    Product Analytics is not:
                    1. Web Analytics
                    2. Marketing Analytics

Product managers are tasked with:

2. Recognizing their business current goals
3. Delivering product work that solves customers problems and drive business impact

Questions to ask:
1. How can we make sure users are successful with our products
2. What's blocking our users from getting value from our products
3. How can we add value to the product that users are willing to pay for
4. Are we building products and features that users want or need
