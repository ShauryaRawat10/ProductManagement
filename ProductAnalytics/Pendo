 Product Analytics: The act of capturing and analyzing how users interact with digital products by calculating product usage
                    Product usage can be measured by 3 ways:
                    1. Trends : Graph engagement with certain features or pages and compare it against other parts of the product over time
                    2. Funnels : Track the levels of drop-off at each step accross specific subset of features and pages in the product
                    3. Paths : View all the product journeys users take either leading up to or following a specific interaction, plus a measure 
                               of how common or uncommon the next step being taken is

                    Product Analytics is not:
                    1. Web Analytics
                    2. Marketing Analytics
                    3. Business Intelligence data

*****************Why product Analytics matters******************
     Product analytics is the act of collecting product usage data

     Product managers are tasked with:
     1. Understanding users and their problems
     2. Recognizing their business current goal
     3. Delivering product work that solves customers problems and drive business impact

     Product managers normally - Questions to ask:
     1. How can we make sure users are successful with our products
     2. What's blocking our users from getting value from our products
     3. How can we add value to the product that users are willing to pay for
     4. Are we building products and features that users want or need

     In the past product managers answered these type of questions by talking to a handful of customers, collecting some internal feedback, 
     and leaning in their own gut feeling or intuition. 
     Oftentimes, it was simply the case that the loudest voice won in terms of what theor prioritize or what functionality to build
     But in order to answer these questions effectively or build products that truely put the customer first, you need data
     Software users prefer tool which are seemless, intuitive or delightful. Improving product starts with how users are engaging with it

     Product analytics provide foundational layer of data that companies can use to measure and optimize their user experience. 
     Analytics is truth. What you see in your product usage data is fact.

     Product managers can use quantitative data to inform decision making at every stage. And uncover insights about their users and products
     that they didnt even know before


     How product analytics can impact your business:
     1. User insights and ROI : What part of the product is being used, how often and by whom. 
                                Using product analytics to correlate insights with other operational metrics to see how product impacts behavior
                                and leads to key business results, such as reduction in support tickets, or increased retention
     2. Growth and experimentation: Unlocks the metrics by which hypotheses are made and meaningful engagement is measured. 
                                With information like no of monthly active users, retention over time, breadth of feature use readily available
                                team can observe a challenge or opportunity in the product, develop a plan, deploy the change, measure outcomes,
                                and iterate with minimum latency or dependencies
     3. Successful digital transformation: Analyze existing workflows and employee behavior to inform decisions about future app purchases and 
                                recommended best practices

     Combining quantitative and qualitative data is important.
     If product Analytics tells you that user move from point A to point B, qualitative data tells you why


************Introduction to Product Analytics Software****************
  Product Analytics software tracks 2 types of data about user interactions:
  1. Events : Any user actions in the software application
              Example: Clicks, Slides, Gestures, Play commands, Downloads, Page loads, Text fields

  2. Event Properties: Specific attributes of tracked interactions
              Example : Device, Software Version, Custom attributes

  Product Analytics have 2 main capabilities:
  1. Tracking : Both at individual user level and account level (multiple user from single customer account, B2B)
  2. Reporting : Both at individual user level and account level
  3. Dashboards : Roll up multiple metrics in single location

  Implementation methods for Product Analytics:
  1. Codeless Analytics : Automatically collects every feature click, screen, page load inside a product, all without tracking code
  2. Instrumented Analytics : Requires tracking code to be installed for almost all interactions in order to collect data for a given
                          feature or product area

***********How analytics fits in product-led strategy**************
   Product-led organizations have 6 characteristics:
   1. Align each function around the product:
            Product experience becomes the driving force behind every function throughout their business
            (Sales, Design, Marketing, Support, Engineering, Customer Success)
   2. Make decisions with data over gut feeling:
            Making product data a shared language across the organization to make more informed decisions
            (Remove unused feature from product, re-engage customer account with low usage, reach out to user whose usage indicate
             they could benefit from other product in the portfolio)
            In this way their is central source of data that is always up-to-date
   3. Use the product as the marketing channel
   4. Have amazing onboarding
   5. Help users help themselves (Self service)
   6. Collect and use feedback from customers

   How team beyond product leverage analytics
   1. Engineering : Engineers can use product data to identify quality issues or product bugs, and then prioritize which issue to address
   2. Marketing teams : They use product usage data to identify power users (highly engaged users) who they can reach out to for 
                    testimonials, beta testing, case studies. and speaking opportunities 
   3. Customer Success teams : CSM can use product analytics to identify if and where users from their accounts are getting stuck, 
                    allowing them to proactively address issues, and stay ahead of customer churn.
   4. Sales team : Using product data to identify users prime for additional products or upgrades, based on how they are currently engaged 
                    with the product

   If your company has a freemium product or offers a free trail, Sales tea, can leverage analytics to how these users engage with your free 
   product or behave during free trial and identify patterns from the users who convert to paying customers - from there sellers know which
   leads to focus on and spend time nurturing the users who are already qualified based on their usage. These are often referred to as Product 
   Qualified leads (PQLs). Similar to marketing qualified leads or MQLs, companies can put PQL framework that maps product usage and behavior
   to the likelihood of making the purchase.


************Data Literacy Glossary**************
   1. Segment : A subset of software user that share comman characteristics, or multiple common characteristics

                eg: August cohort of your users are your new users who started using the product in the month of august 
   3. Behaviral cohorts : same as segments
   4. Path Analysis : Allows you to visualize what users are doing before or after using a specific page or feature within your application
   5. Funnel Analysis : Allows you to measure how customer move through a defined series of steps in your application
                Product teams can use these learnings to make adjustment to the product to keep users engaged in their workflow steps
   6. Aquisition : In the world of software, refers to the process of gaining new users of your product
   7. Product Adoption : Measures when users understand your products value and perform certain actions, like engaging with key feature (Stickiness)
   8. Retention : Measures the percentage of users or customer accounts still using your product after they initially install or start 
                  using it
